* I am a Posdoc in the AI center at [Pengcheng Lab](http://www.pcl.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Yonghong Tian](https://www.pkuml.org/staff/yhtian.html). [[Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/owuchangyuo/owuchangyuo.github.io/blob/master/files/YiChang-CV.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=I1nZ67YAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of computer vision and image processing, particularly in hyperspectral image restoration, structural noise removal and event-based camera image reconstruction.
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in automation from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China in 2011,  the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree with the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation in 2019. From 2014 to 2015, I was a Research Assistant with Peking University, Beijing, China. I was a Research Intern with the Tencent Youtu Lab, Shenzhen, China.
