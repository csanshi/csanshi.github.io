## Abstract
Ground-based astronomical images usually suffer from the degradation of random noise, which has a negative impact on the subsequent performance. It is expected that local and nonlocal variations are the two sides of the same coin in image modeling. However, most of existing denoising methods focus on modeling the sparsity of local patches or the nonlocal self-similarity information individually, which may result in poor image structure representation ability. To remedy this issue, we propose a unified approach via combining the framelet and the low-rank prior scheme for astronomical image denoising. On one hand, the synthesis-based low-rank prior is employed to reveal the intrinsic low-dimensional subspace (namely the main edges) of the similar patches. On the other hand, the analysis-based framelet prior is introduced to capture the local subtle texture structures. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this combination, and the
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising methods.
