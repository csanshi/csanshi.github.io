## Abstract
Remote sensing images destriping and denoising are both classical problems, which have attracted major research efforts separately. This letter shows that the two problems can be successfully solved together within a unified variational framework. To do this, we proposed a joint destriping and denoising method by integrating the unidirectional total variation and sparse representation regularizations. Experimental results on simulated and real data in terms of qualitative and quantitative assessments show significant improvements over conventional methods.
