## Abstract
Deblurring and destriping are both classical problems for remote sensing images, which are known to be difficult. Treating deblurring and destriping separately, such a straightforward approach, however, suffers greatly from the defective output. This paper shows that the two problems can be successfully solved together and benefit greatly from each other within a unified variational framework. To do this, we propose a joint deblurring and destriping method by
combining the framelet regularization and unidirectional total variation. Extensive experiments on simulation and real remote sensing images are carried out and the results of our joint model show significant improvement over conventional methods of treating the two tasks separately.
