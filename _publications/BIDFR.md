## Abstract
We propose a maximum a posteriori blind Poissonian images deconvolution approach with framelet regularization for the image and total variation (TV) regularization for the point spread function. Compared with the TV based
methods, our algorithm not only suppresses noise effectively but also recovers edges and detailed information. Moreover, the split Bregman method is exploited to solve the resulting minimization problem. Comparative results
on both simulated and real images are reported.
